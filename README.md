# ClassBuilder AI Discord Bot

ClassBuilder AI is a powerful, multi-functional Discord bot designed to be the ultimate study assistant. Powered by the high-speed Groq API and the Llama 3 model, this bot transforms raw text and documents into structured study materials, answers questions with conversational context, and helps manage your Discord channels.

This project upgrades a previous version that used local Hugging Face models, replacing them with a robust, fast, and intelligent API-driven backend for significantly improved performance and quality.
